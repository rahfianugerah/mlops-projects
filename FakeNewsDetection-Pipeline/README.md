| Problem Statement | <p align=justify>In the digital era, the spread of fake news (hoaxes) is increasingly rampant through social media and online platforms. Fake news is often created for the purpose of manipulating public opinion or for profit, making it difficult for people to distinguish between factual and fake information. This has a negative impact, triggering confusion and distrust among the public. Therefore, the development of an effective fake news detection system is essential to help people identify accurate information, improve media literacy, and reduce the adverse impact of hoaxes.</p> |
| Machine Learning Solution | <p align=justify>From the problems described, there is a need for a system that can detect fake news by applying machine learning technology. This system is designed to identify and separate fake news from real news effectively, with the aim of reducing the spread of misleading information.</p> |
| Processing Method | <p align=justify>In this project, the data processing method used is input feature tokenization. This process converts the text of a news story into an array of numbers that represent the text, so that it can be easily understood by the model. Tokenization allows the model to process and understand the text by converting words into numerical tokens, which are then used as inputs in the model for further analysis and fake news detection. This method is important to ensure that the model can interpret and process text data with high accuracy.</p> |
| Model Architecture | <p align=justify>The model utilizes the TextVectorization layer to convert the input text into a series of numbers. After that, the Embedding layer is used to learn the vector representation of the words in the text. This process allows the model to understand the similarity between words and determine whether a word has a negative or positive meaning.</p> |
| Evaluation Metrics | <p align=justify>The evaluation metrics used in the model to evaluate performance in determining paraphrase classification are AUC (Area Under the Curve), BinaryAccuracy, True Positive (TP), False Positive (FP), True Negative (TN), and False Negative (FN). AUC measures the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes. BinaryAccuracy assesses the percentage of correct predictions out of all predictions. True Positive and True Negative indicate the number of correct predictions for positive and negative classes, while False Positive and False Negative indicate the number of incorrect predictions for positive and negative classes. The combination of these metrics provides an overall picture of the model's effectiveness in detecting and classifying paraphrases with high accuracy.</p> |
| Model Performance | <p align=justify>The developed model shows a very satisfactory performance in predicting news content based on the given text. Through the training process, the model achieved an accuracy rate of 98.8% in identifying whether a news story is fake or real. This result demonstrates the model's ability to perform news classification very well.</p> |
